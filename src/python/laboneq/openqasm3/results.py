class ExternResult:
    """A class for holding the result of an extern function that
    needs to play a section, perform a measurement or other operations in
    addition to returning a result.

    Arguments:
    ---------
        result:
            The result returned by the extern function.
        handle:
            The measurement handle that holds the result returned by
            the extern function. Only one of handle or result
            may be specified.
        section:
            The section the extern function would like to have played at the
            point in the OpenQASM function where it is called. Sections cannot
            be played inside an expression -- the call to the extern must be
            directly a statement or the right-hand side of an assignment.

    Attributes:
    ----------
        result (Any):
            The result returned by the extern function.
        handle (str | None):
            The measurement handle holding the result.
        section (Section | None):
            The section the extern function wishes to play.
